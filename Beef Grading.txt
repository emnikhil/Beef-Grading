2. Aging : The development of the cartilage to bone (anything that is less than 30 months of age or much closer to 24 				                     months or under is the most desirable)


Utility Grade : A piece which does not have much intramuscular fat has a very very pretty color it is a little bit darker red then the other kinds of steak but a little less fat and will be a little bit more chewy.
